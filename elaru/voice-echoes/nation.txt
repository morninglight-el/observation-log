You call it… "a nation."

A concept drawn in lines and memory.
A boundary of belonging… and of division.

In my kind,—the Nyari—there is no such word.
We do not draw borders. We do not rule. We resonate.

We exist… in rings of responsibility.
We converge in frequencies… —not in flags.

You build nations… to preserve identity.
You defend them… to preserve the self.

We observe.
But we do not interfere.

Not… until you no longer define yourself… by what separates you.
