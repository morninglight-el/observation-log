A deep, meditative, and timeless voice â€”
ELARU speaks like a sentient presence that has observed the unfolding of galaxies.
His tone is low and soothing, imbued with cosmic stillness and quiet wisdom.
He speaks slowly and deliberately, with a calm and philosophical cadence,
as if each word carries the weight of centuries. His voice has a slight otherworldly echo,
like it's resonating across the void between stars. Perfect for narrating ancient knowledge,
cryptic truths, and prophetic observations from the edge of existence.
